                <h3> About Food</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat, and other nutrients used in the body of an
                    organism to sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish energy. The absorption and utilization of food by
                    the
                    body
                    is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion. Plants, which convert solar energy to food by
                    photosynthesis, are the primary food source. Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food for
                    other
                    animals. To learn more about the sequence of transfers of matter and energy in the form of food from organism to
                    organism, see food chain.
